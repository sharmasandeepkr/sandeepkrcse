I am Computer Science Engineer seeking to explore the modern approch to networking based application which is ideal for 
                       Decentralised and distributed computation. It is more over based on sharing memory which is now adays throttling era with 
                       new fast and concurrent compiler based language k/a golang which is developed and maintained by google lab. distributed 
                       application is not only  a topic of networking overlays rather it provides efficiency to old server-client based architecture.
